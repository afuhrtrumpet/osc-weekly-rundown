# [DROWN](https://drownattack.com/)

- A recently discovered padding oracle attack against SSLv2
- If a server is running SSLv2, an attacker can gain information about the
  private key
    - Can then decrypt strong TLS sessions
- Disable SSLv2 or use different keys

# [Vantablack](http://www.surreynanosystems.com/vantablack/faqs)

- Vantablack is the world's darkest man-made substance absorbing 99.964% of light
- "Surrey NanoSystems Ltd (SNS) is the only manufacturer of Vantablack coatings"
- Surrey nanosystems have licensed Vantablack exclusively to Anish Kapoor, a British-Indian sculptor
- Introduces an unheard of monopoly on a material in the art world

# [Apple v FBI and "Virtually Limitless" Surveillance](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/03/apple-all-writs-act-and-limitless-surveillance)
* Federal judge rejects government's request to break open locked iPhone.
* Judge fears potential "virtually limitless" surveillance under IoT.
* You agree to Apple's software licensing agreement when you use the device.
* Government argues that this is proof that Apple is "sufficiently close" to consumer devices to be compelled to unlock them.
* In other words, government is arguing that you do not own your iPhone ~ in some general sense, Apple does.

# Full quote from judge:

> As constantly increasing computing power is continually squeezed into ever
> smaller storage devices, the category of consumer products containing
> licensed software will continue to grow. In a world in which so many devices,
> not just smartphones, will be connected to the Internet of Things, the
> government's theory that a licensing agreement allows it to compel the
> manufacturers of such products to help it surveil(sic) the products' users will
> result in a virtually limitless expansion of the government's legal authority
> to surreptitiously intrude on personal privacy.

# General Updates on Encrpytion Stuff
* Amazon, FaceBook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo support Apple.
* French bill carries 5 year jail sentence for company that refuses to decrypt data for police via [DailyDot](http://www.dailydot.com/politics/amazon-encryption-kindle-fire-operating-system/)
* Amazon removes enterprise level encrpytion on tablet devices via [DailyDot](http://www.dailydot.com/politics/amazon-encryption-kindle-fire-operating-system/)
* Piers Morgan and his [*brilliant*](https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/703355614966255616) idea on what to do:

> Apple open the damn back door, let the FBI know what's on the phone, then
> close it again.
> This isn't difficult.

# LAN Party

- OSC and BuckeyeLAN are hosting a LAN party March 26th
