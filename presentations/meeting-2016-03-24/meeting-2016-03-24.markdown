# [kik, left-pad, and npm](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/141577284765/kik-left-pad-and-npm)
* Earlier this week something happened that broke many things...
* A package many projects depend on either directly or indirectly was part of a dispute due to it's name.
* Event is significant on many notes.
* Here's what happened.

# NPM sends the Internet in a tizzy
* [Azer KoÃ§ulu](https://twitter.com/azerbike) and [Kik](https://www.kik.com) correspond over the use of the module name [```kik```](https://medium.com/@mproberts/a-discussion-about-the-breaking-of-the-internet-3d4d2a83aa4d).

. . .

* They did not come to an agreement and Kik asked NPM org to step in.
* [Azer](https://medium.com/@azerbike/i-ve-just-liberated-my-modules-9045c06be67c#.69jgzns8x) deletes his account and unpublishes his packages. 

. . .

* One of the packages he unpublished was called [```left-pad```](https://www.npmjs.com/package/left-pad).
* This package was a dependencies in thousands of node modules.
* The unpublishing caused them to fail...

. . .

* All of this happened over [11 SLOC](sourceod://www.npmjs.com/package/left-pad).
