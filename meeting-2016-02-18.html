## [SONY Music Takedown on Music Copyright Lecture](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160214/08293233599/sony-music-issues-takedown-copyright-lecture-about-music-copyrights-harvard-law-professor.shtml)
* Lecture on music copy right by Harvard Law professor William Fisher.
* Lecture is under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0
* Fisher played a few clips of songs ranging from 15s to 45s.
* Falls ***without question*** within the spectrum of fair abuse.

## [Windows DLLs and ```MOV EDI, EDI``` instruction](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20110921-00/?p=9583)
* Windows DLLs begin with a ```MOV EDI, EDI``` instruction.
* Instruction copies value in register ```EDI``` and moves it into...```EDI```.
* 2 byte ```NOOP``` instruction to enable hot-patching.
* Allows for hot patches to run ***without*** needing to reboot Windows or restart application.
* At run time the 2-byte ```NOOP``` is replaced by a short jump to a long jump to hot-fix function.
	* ```MOV EDI, EDI``` gets replaced with two-byte ```JMP $-5``` instruction.
	* Redirects to some space that is 5 bytes long.
	* 5 bytes is enough for a full jump to the patch.
* 2 byte instruction is required so the instruction pointer will not point to the middle of an instruction.
